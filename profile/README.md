# REI 🤖📘🌒

> A machine-native web framework for compositional execution and AI-driven systems. 🌑

---

## Overview

REI is a web framework designed for environments where **language models are active participants** in system construction, inspection, and evolution.

It is inspired by stack-based execution models, compositional semantics, and virtual machines that favor **explicit state** over hidden abstraction.

REI is not optimized for human ergonomics.  
It is optimized for **mechanical clarity**.

Humans can read REI systems.  
Machines are expected to write them.

If this feels quiet, that is intentional.
